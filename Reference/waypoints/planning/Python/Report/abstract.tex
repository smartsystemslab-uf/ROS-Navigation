%\section{Abstract}
\begin{abstract}
This work addresses decentralized coordination of autonomous robots with assistance from overhead path planning cameras. I propose a solution that utilizes the performance of a decentralized system and handles dynamic environments in an efficient manner. Path planning was simulated in serial on various, randomized environments to show effectiveness. Path planning was then modified to operate in a multithreaded environment. This modification allowed for more realistic simulation of a multi-agent environment. This method efficiently handles the cases where other robot navigation methods are otherwise weak or ineffective.
